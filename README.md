# Linux configurations
Fairly minimal setup on Arch Linux using Hyprland window manager.  
I am using pywal to scan the wallpaper colors and styling different components with the results.  
My workspace setup is as follows:  
- Odd numbered workspaces on my right hand side monitor (main monitor, 27" 1440p )  
- Even numbered workspaces on my left hand side monitor (32" 4k)  

Wallpapers are randomized fron my wallpaper directory on startup or on demand and all appropriate colors are also updated.
