# Linux configurations
Fairly minimal setup on Arch Linux using Hyprland window manager.  
I am using pywal to scan the wallpaper colors and styling different components with the results.  
My workspace setup is as follows:  
- Odd numbered workspaces on my right hand side monitor (main monitor, 27" 1440p )  
- Even numbered workspaces on my left hand side monitor (32" 4k)  

Wallpapers are randomized to both of my monitors from my wallpaper directory on startup or on demand and all appropriate colors are also updated.
